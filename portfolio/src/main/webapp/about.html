          <p>At Pomona College, I work at several on-campus offices and organizations.</p>
          <p>I have been a <span class="office-links">Tour Guide</span> for the Admissions Office since the second semester of my first year.
          Leading tours is always a lot of fun because I get to know many amazing high school students and could offer a little help with their college application journeys.
          I also participated in other exciting activities organized by the office, which includes the shooting of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joi73YzGTpk&t=21s">Sagehen Next</a>, 
          a parody of Ariana Grande's "Thank you, Next". This music video was produced as a part of a series of activities to welcome Pomona Class of 2023.</p></div>

        <div><figcaption>I'm standing next to Cecil, Pomona-Pitzer's mascot, in Sagehen, Next</figcaption>

        <p class="below-image-cap">I also work at Office of Housing and Residence Life as a <span class="office-links">Residence Advisor</span>. 
          I enjoy organizing events for my residents and collaborating with on-campus offices, organizations and other RAs. Two social events that are most memorable to me are the Note-taking 101 workshop, 
          where we learned about note-taking tips and brush lettering techniques, and the Ice Cream Social, where we chatted over icecream as we got to know each other in the beginning of the school year.

        <p> I'm also employed at the Career Development Office as a <span class="office-links">Student Assistant</span>, where I perform front desk duties and help students navigate 
          the resources available at the office. 
          We are also proud to be <a href="http://voices.pomona.edu/2019/10/caffeine-in-claremont-a-comprehensive-guide/">one of the best places for coffee</a> in Claremont, 
          according to Voices, Pomona College Student Blog. </p>
