      <h3> #1: Data analysis programs used in the study of Perovskite solar cells</h3>
      <p> I am passionate about coding and creating inclusive and useful products.</p>
      <p> Last summer, I worked as a Research Assistant in a Physics Lab at Pomona College, where we fabricated, analyzed and assessed perovskite solar cells. 
          Perovskite is an emerging material that has the potential to compete with other traditionally used sources to produce solar cells, and 
          obtaining more concrete evidence regarding its adaptability, resilience and prospect of mass production is important as we move forward into a more sustainable future.</p>
      <p> Working in the laboratory, I created 5 Python programs that conducted data extraction, analysis and organization processes, which replaced the primarily manual processes and allowed for more time and effort focused on
          evaluating cells' performance and deciding next steps. </p>
      <p> During the research, I learned about available opensource libraries such as panda and matplotlib to write my programs in the most efficient way possible. 
          It was a rewarding time because I did not have prior knowledge of those libraries, 
          and the exposure motivated me to further pursue computer science-related opportunities. </p>
      <p> The code and documentation could be found on my <a href="https://github.com/phuongnguyen00/data-analysis-solar-cells">GitHub account</a>.</p>

        <h3> #2: YouTube channel where I shared my knowledge about computer science</h3>
        <p> COVID-19 has disrupted our lives and presented us with multiple uncertainties about the future. 
            My classes and most of the activities I participated on-campus got cancelled, which made me realize that I got much more free
            time than I used to. Our Spring Break also got extended, and I felt that I may forget all of the knowledge from my CS classes
            that I have worked so hard to build on due to the stress and sadness that overcame me.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I created a Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQkW2mB1FhM_JvCfxuqk2w"> Code and Notes</a> that allowed me to practice two things that I am really passionate about: 
            taking beautiful, organized notes and writing clean, useful code. I practiced brush lettering that calmed me (and it's also aesthetically pleasing), and reviewed some algorithms that I
            learned in my Data Structures class on the channel. </p> <br>

        <p> I also created a public Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/phuongsalmon/">@phuongsalmon</a> where I plan to share photos regarding my interests with everyone.
            I have not posted much, but I think this is also another way to destress and get more motivated and optimistic about the life I am leading.
